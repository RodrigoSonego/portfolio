science-title=AR Science
science-desc=AR Science is an Augmented Reality mobile app that is used in tandem with a science textbook to illustrate various 3D scenes that auxiliate the learning of students in middle school. The user points their phone camera at an "AR Code" and the 3D visualization appears. Published on Android and IoS along with four other similar apps that tackles different contents.

unfishing=Game made for the GMTK Game Jam 2023, with the theme "Roles Reversed". In this game, you play as a fish trying to "unfish" food from the hooks peeking underwater. Just as fishing mechanics in other games, you have to solve minigames in order to unfish the worms from the hooks, bringing them home to feed your family!
dicest=Game made for the GMTK Game Jam 2022, with the theme "Roll of the Dice". This game is heavily inspired by the likes of Darkest Dungeon, with a similar combat structure. The setting is a casino in which you attack your enemies by throwing dice at them, and the damage will be the roll result!
fg-desc=Fighting Game prototype made in Unity. Uses python to implement the Deep Q-Learning algorithm to make the AI learn the optimal way to play against its opponent.
render-title=C++ Render Engine
render-desc=Engine made in C++ that renders 3D models, textures, 2D sprites and animations on spritesheets.

science-subtitle=AR educational app for Android and IoS
scien-sum-1=AR Science is an Augmented Reality mobile app that is used in tandem with a science	textbook to illustrate various 3D scenes that auxiliate the learning of students in middle school. The user points their phone camera at an "AR Code" and the 3D visualization appears. Published on Android and IoS along with four other similar apps that tackles different contents.
scien-sum-2=Along with AR Science, I also helped in the development of 4 other apps that follow the	same idea, but themed around diffent subjects, such as geography, math, biology and space. This app, along with its similar ones, are being used today in schools around Brazil helping hundreds of middle school students.

scien-accol=The app collection was shown in national Brazilian TV, explaining the importance and advantages of technological methods in education, video below:

###### Technologies #####
tech=Technologies Used

##### Unfishing ######
unfish-subtitle="Fishing" game made for GMTK Game Jam 2023
unfish-sum-1=Unfishing is a game where you control Bob, an everyday hard-working fish, on his adventure to "unfish" worms from the hooks thrown in the water. Each day he has to meet a quota of food while struggling to not get caught by the hooks.
unfish-sum-2=Starting with the theme of 'Roles Reversed', our team decided on the ideia of how fishing minigames worked, and so we made a fishing game, but you are the fish. Similar to fishing minigames you see in other titles, when trying to get the worm from the hook, you trigger a minigame in order to not get hooked. There are currently three minigames chosen at random when taking a bait. If you fail the minigames three times, you get hooked. The number of worms required increases with each level, as well as the speed and difficulty of the minigames.

##### Dicest ######
dice-subtitle=Turn-based game for GMTK Jam 2022
dice-sum-1=Dicest Dungeon is a game heavily inspired by the likes of Darkest Dungeon, where you walk through a dungeon (or, in this case, a casino) and fight monsters in turn-based battles. The game has you walking through a casino in order to take down the boss. In this casino, the battles are a bet, and your only weapon is your dice (which you literally throw at your enemy)!

##### Fighting RL #####
rl-sum-1=This is a project done as part of my bachelor's thesis on Computer Science. The idea was to make a simple fighting game prototype and develop an AI that can learn how to play with the player through Deep Reinforcement Learning.
rl-sum-2=In order to link Python with Unity, or rather, with C#, the Python.NET library was used, allowing to call Python from within C#.
rl-sum-3=As it stands now the prototype consists of a really basic fighting game with a light and heavy attack, and a block button similar to Mortal Kombat. It can be played as Player vs RL-AI or it can be done as RL-AI vs regular AI.
respon-fg=Developing the fighting game mechanics
respon-ai-net=Determining AI parameters and network config
respon-learn=Adapting the learning algorithm

##### Render Engine #####
render-subtitle=Graphics Engine made in c++
render-sum=A simple engine that uses OpenGL to render 2D sprites and animate from spritesheets. It also has a side-scroller demo game (only visuals and inputs working) inspired by Xenon 2000 to show the rendering capabilities. There is also a branch that handles the loading, texture mapping and rendering of 3D objects.
respon-load-obj=Load 2D sprites and 3D .obj files
respon-demo=Developing the demo "game"
respon-cam-shaders=Developing camera and shaders
respon-spritesheet=Animating sprites from spritesheet
respon-map=Mapping textures to 3D objects

scien-sum-1=AR Science is an Augmented Reality mobile app that is used in tandem with a science	textbook to illustrate various 3D scenes that auxiliate the learning of students in middle school. The user points their phone camera at an "AR Code" and the 3D visualization appears. Published on Android and IoS along with four other similar apps that tackles different contents.
scien-sum-2=Along with AR Science, I also helped in the development of 4 other apps that follow the	same idea, but themed around diffent subjects, such as geography, math, biology and space. This app, along with its similar ones, are being used today in schools around Brazil helping hundreds of middle school students.
